# The birthday greetings kata

A refactoring exercise to learn about dependency inversion and hexagonal architecture. Inspired by a [blog post][kata-blog] from [Matteo Vaccari][mateo-vaccari]. You can find the original [repo here][kata-repo].

## Solution

I decided to solve the problem in a functional programming style using the Kotlin programming language and [Arrow][arrow-kt], a functional companion to the Kotlin standard library.
